    <h1>What is Reynolds Number?</h1>
    <p>The dimensionless Reynolds number plays a prominent role in foreseeing the patterns in a fluid’s behavior. The Reynolds number, referred to as Re, is used to determine whether the fluid flow is laminar or turbulent. It is one of the main controlling parameters in all viscous flows where a numerical model is selected according to pre-calculated Reynolds number.

        Although the Reynolds number comprises both static and kinetic properties of fluids, it is specified as a flow property since dynamic conditions are investigated. Technically speaking, the Reynolds number is the ratio of the inertial forces to the viscous forces. This ratio helps to categorize laminar flows from the turbulent ones.

Sign Up
Inertial forces resist a change in the velocity of an object and are the cause of the fluid movement. These forces are dominant in turbulent flows. Otherwise, if the viscous forces, defined as the resistance to flow, are dominant – the flow is laminar. The Reynolds number can be specified as below:

Re=inertial forceviscous force=fluid and flow propertiesfluid properties(1)
For instance, a glass of water which stands on a static surface, regardless of any forces apart from gravity, is at rest and flow properties are ignored. Thus, the numerator in equation (1) is “0”. That results in independence from the Reynolds number for a fluid at rest. On the other hand, whilst water is spilled by tilting a water-filled glass a Reynolds number can be estimated to predict fluid flow
